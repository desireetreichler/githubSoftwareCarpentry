Difference between corporate and private account: with uio account you cannot make your repository public. Github private: everything is public (unless you pay)

This readme: stored as markdown language. 
hash tag: heading 1


Make a new repository: 
"+"   -> name it, public (private is paid)

Edit it: with the pen -> two tabs, edit and preview changes ("the diff"), e.g. adding or deleting text. 

Make a new file: 
"create new file" -> commit changes: you can give your changes a name

On the repository main page: 
Commits -> view all your commits (and diffs), each change has a unique code that stores your diff (e.g.  38ec376aed7cca048604a1976bf33c877d9daf8f @desireetreichler desireetreichler committed on GitHub 4 minutes ago ) that can also be commented
The first line in any commit are instructions on where to add/delete lines (change files)




To print it: plugin in chrome, or clone it locally and use the tools there.
