Difference between corporate and private account: with uio account you cannot make your repository public. Github private: everything is public (unless you pay)

This readme: stored as markdown language (.md). 
* hash tag: heading 1
* line break: needs double space, otherwise it will be ignored..?
* asterisk: bulleted list
* number and dot: numbered list - numbers correctly even if you mix up the numbers!
* italics: underscore, bold: asterisk, code mode: accent grave - before and after


Make a new repository: 
"+"   -> name it, public (private is paid)

Edit it: with the pen -> two tabs, edit and preview changes ("the diff"), e.g. adding or deleting text. 

Make a new file: 
"create new file" -> commit changes: you can give your changes a name

On the repository main page: 
Commits -> view all your commits (and diffs), each change has a unique code that stores your diff (e.g.  38ec376aed7cca048604a1976bf33c877d9daf8f @desireetreichler desireetreichler committed on GitHub 4 minutes ago ) that can also be commented  
The first line in any commit are instructions on where to add/delete lines (change files)


Collaborate:
Tab "Settings", -> "Collaborators".
Collaborators get an email when you comment on their commit.

Comments: Possible on commits only, not on the file directly! - but you can click on the number in front of a line to create a link that points directly to that place in a file: 
https://github.com/desireetreichler/guacamole-recipe/blob/master/instructions#L4

Issues: (tab)
Create a new task to to. Written in markdown. You can also assign this to a person and discuss it interactively (in comments)

Pull requests: (tab)
Requires that first a new branch is opened, and something is changed there - for example, the instructions list. 


To print it: plugin in chrome, or clone it locally and use the tools there.
